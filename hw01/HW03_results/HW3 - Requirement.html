		<h3>
			1  Goal
		</h3>
		<p>
			To improve the run time and image smoothness of your ray tracer.
		</p>

		<h3>
			2  Supplied Code
		</h3>
		<p>
			None.
		</p>

		<h3>
			3  Requirements
		</h3>
		<h4>
			3.1  Bounding Box Class (15 points)
		</h4>
		<p>
			Create a class called BoundingBox which inherits from the Drawable class. This means the BoundingBox needs to implement the create() and drawMode() functions, which will be described in a later section. The BoundingBox should contain the minimum and maximum bounds of the Geometry to which it is attached (or the BVH node to which it is attached). By default, these are stored in world space coordinates. It should also have a way to get its centerpoint (the average of its bounds).
			<br/><br/>
			Additionally, add a BoundingBox pointer as a member variable to the Geometry class, making sure to set this pointer to NULL in the Geometry constructor. Each Geometry class will have to implement a function that sets the bounds of its Bounding Box. Both the Mesh class and the Triangle class will implement this function, since each Mesh will contain its own BVH tree to store its triangles.
		</p>
		<h4>
			3.2  BVH Node Class and BVH Tree Construction (30 points)
		</h4>
		<p>
			Create a BVH Node class that will be used within the IntersectionEngine class to hold all of the scene's objects. Each BVH Node will contain a pointer to a Left Child, a pointer to a Right Child, and an instance of a Bounding Box.
			<br/><br/>
			The IntersectionEngine class should contain a pointer to the root of your BVH tree. When a scene is loaded via MyGL::SceneLoadDialog, its geometry should be sorted into a BVH tree and the root of this tree should be stored in the IntersectionEngine. To this end, at the end of MyGL::SceneLoadDialog, add functionality that clears and re-creates the BVH Tree (since the geometry of the scene will be entirely new). When constructing a BVH tree, you'll want to partition the scene's geometry from the top down using a SPLIT_EQUAL_COUNTS partition algorithm. Use a different world axis at each recursion. A geometry should end up in one and only one leaf BVH Node.
		</p>
		<h4>
			3.3  BVH Tree Intersection (25 points)
		</h4>
		<p>
			Within the IntersectionEngine, use the BVH tree to test for intersection with objects in the scene. The BVH Node class will have to implement a GetIntersection function, as will the Bounding Box class. Unlike the intersection testing you implemented in homework 1, testing for intersection with a BVH tree will be a depth-first recursive function rather than a simple one-by-one intersection test.
		</p>
		<h4>
			3.4  Visualizing Bounding Boxes (10 points)
		</h4>
		<p>
			Inside the create() function that Bounding Box inherits from Drawable, initialize vertex buffer objects to draw lines connecting each corner of the bounding box to its adjacent corners, creating a wireframe box. Its color is up to you, though we suggest something that stands out such as fuchsia. A Bounding Box's create() function should only be called after its bounds have been set. In addition to create(), also implement drawMode() so it sets the draw mode of the Bounding Box to GL_LINES (look at Camera's implementation for an example). This will have OpenGL draw the box as a wireframe rather than a solid mesh.
		</p>
		<h4>
			3.5  Anti-Aliasing Methods (15 points)
		</h4>
		<p>
			Implement the <i>GetSamples</i> function for the StratifiedPixelSampler class and the UniformPixelSampler classes. The stratified sampler should divide the given pixel into an NxN grid and then sample randomly within each grid cell (N is the number of subdivisions defined in the sampler). The uniform sampler should simply return N^2 evenly-spaced samples within the given pixel. Additionally, create a RandomPixelSampler class in the style of the StratifiedPixelSampler class and have it return N^2 randomly spaced samples within the given pixel.
		</p>
		<h4>
			3.6  Speed Testing (5 points)
		</h4>
		<p>
			Using the QTimer class, have your program print out the time it took to render an image in milliseconds. Record the render times for the many_spheres.xml and wahoo.xml files using your BVH tree, <b>without</b> using your BVH tree, and when using 1x1, 2x2, and 4x4 samples with the different pixel samplers.
		</p>
		<h3>
			4  Extra Credit (30 points max)
		</h3>
		<h4>
			4.1  Better BVH Partitioning -  Surface Area Heuristic SPLIT_SAH (15 points)
		</h4>
		<p>
			Implement a surface area heuristic to determine the optimal splitting plane for a given depth of your BVH tree, rather than simply splitting along the center of the tree.
		</p>
		<h4>
			4.2  Image-wide stratified sampling (15 points)
		</h4>
		<p>
			Rather than stratifying your samples on a per-pixel level, implement a pixel super-sampling algorithm that ensures no two samples <b>across the entire image</b> are within a certain distance of each other. One somewhat slow way to achieve this is to generate N random samples within the desired pixel and choose the sample that is furthest from all samples previously taken in the image.
